### OHBM 2022 ###

In 2022, the Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) once again welcomed participants in person at its [28th annual meeting in Glasgow](https://www.humanbrainmapping.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4114). It was an inspiring event which showcased all the exciting developments. Automatic Analysis has also been represented by these projects:

#### Decoding frequency-specific modulation of fMRI network connectivity: a tACS study ####

This exciting project by Tibor Auer, Romy Lorenz, Ines Violante proposes multivariate pattern analyses (MVPA) to demonstrate whether tACS has differentiable effects on regional BOLD activity and connectivity within the brain networks which allow to decode the stimulation frequency.

The workflow combines [SPM12](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12), [CONN](https://web.conn-toolbox.org), and [TDT](https://sites.google.com/site/tdtdecodingtoolbox) toolboxes and extracts and analyses fMRI activity and connectivity features at voxel, ROI, and network levels.

The full abstract and the poster PFD is available at Figshare ([DOI:10.6084/m9.figshare.20300820.v1](https://figshare.com/articles/conference_contribution/Decoding_frequency-specific_modulation_of_fMRI_network_connectivity_a_tACS_study/20300820/1)).
