## What is aa, and why use it? ##
Automatic analysis (aa) is a pipeline specification tool for neuroimaging written in Matlab. It provides scriptable access to many popular imaging packages, as well as a variety of third party SPM toolboxes.

See the [aa wiki](https://github.com/automaticanalysis/automaticanalysis/wiki) for more information.

## How the story started... ##
automatic analysis software was originally developed by Dr Rhodri Cusack for supporting research at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit. It is made available to the academic community in the hope that it may prove useful.
