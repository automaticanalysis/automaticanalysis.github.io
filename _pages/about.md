## How the story started... ##
automatic analysis software was originally developed by Dr Rhodri Cusack for supporting research at the MRC Cognition and Brain Science Unit. It is made available to the academic community in the hope that it may prove useful.

## Core concepts ##

### Tight integration of foundation tools
"automatic" also means automatic management of external tools, which 
- handles external codebase with flexibility and transparently
- reduces conflict between external tools
- requires minimum input from the user

This concept is implemented via the [toolbox framework]({% link ../toolboxes.md %})
